# predict-the-winner-of-a-basketball-game
we will predict the winner of a basketball game based on the scores observed in the first 3 quarters of the game. Each column represents the beginning of a minute during the game. (There are 12 minutes in each quarter. There are 3 quarters in the data, so we have 36 columns as input variables in chronological order.) The values captured in each column represent the score difference observed at that minute (home score minus away score)


The last column W represents whether the home team (1) or the away team (0) won the game. This is the target variable.

Our unit of analysis is a single game.
